## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a playground for experimenting with high-performance computing and parallel processing frameworks, including:

- **OpenCL**
- **CUDA**
- **Pthreads**
- **OpenMP**
- **MPI**

The main language is **C++**, with some C, CUDA, and build files.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (for CUDA samples)
- [OpenCL SDK](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)
- [MPI Library](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
- Make or CMake

### Build & Run

**Using Make:**
```sh
make
Using CMake:

sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
Navigate to the relevant directory for specific examples and instructions.
